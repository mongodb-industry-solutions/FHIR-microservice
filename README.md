MongoDB offers a range of Atlas App Services, that have extensive serverless backend capabilities. One such capability is Atlas data API, which allows you to create an endpoint for the read and write access in a specific cluster. You can enable authentication and customize the data access on the collections, based on the rules that you can define with the App Services Rules.

[In this blog post](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/how-build-healthcare-interoperability-microservice-using-fhir-mongodb/), we will walk you through how you can expose the data of a FHIR compliant collection through Atlas Data API to two different users with different permissions.
